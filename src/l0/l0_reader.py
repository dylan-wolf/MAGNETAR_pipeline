def demodulate(data):
    '''
    This function will demodulate raw time stream with either a square or sine wave form.
    Prior to this a number of filtering steps must be performed to identify good data.
    Raw data is filtered with a box high-pass filter with a time constant of one over the chop frequency.
    Then, any data taken during telescope movement (line-of-sight rewinds, for example, or tracking errors) is flagged for removal. In square wave demodulation, samples are then tagged as being in the high-chop state, low-chop state, or in between (not used). For each complete chop cycle within a single nod position at a single HWP angle, the pipeline computes the average of the signal in the high-chop state and subtracts it from the average of the signal in the low-chop state. Incomplete chop cycles at the end of a nod or HWP position are discarded. The sine-wave demodulation proceeds similarly, except that the data are weighted by a sine wave instead of being considered either purely high or purely low state.
    During demodulation, the data is also corrected for the phase delay in the readout of each pixel, relative to the chopper signal. For square wave demodulation, the phase delay time is multiplied by the sample frequency to calculate the delay in data samples for each individual pixel. The data is then shifted by that many samples before demodulating. For sine wave demodulation, the phase delay time is multiplied with 2ùúã times the chop frequency to get the phase shift of the demodulating wave-form in radians.
    Alongside the chop-subtracted flux, the pipeline calculates the error on the raw data during demodulation. It does so by taking the mean of all data samples at the same chop phase, nod position, HWP angle, and detector pixel, then calculates the variance of each raw data point with respect to the appropriate mean. The square root of this value gives the standard deviation of the raw flux. The pipeline will propagate these calculated error estimates throughout the rest of the data reduction steps.
    The result of the demodulation process is a chop-subtracted, time-averaged flux value and associated variance for each nod position, HWP angle, and detector pixel. The output is stored in a new FITS table, in the extension called DEMODULATED DATA, which replaces the TIMESTREAM data extension. The CONFIGURATION extension is left unmodified.
